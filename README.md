# Super Awakening

`Super Awakening` is a `Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening` romhack for the `Super Game Boy`.  The romhack enables additional controls and new gameplay feature that are designed to be played with a `Super Nintendo` controller.

This fork removes the "Quick restock" feature from the hack. That's all. The proper credit goes to [cphartman](https://github.com/cphartman), the original author of [Super Awakening](https://github.com/cphartman/super-awakening/tree/main).
